  <p>A homo sapien learns its environment by investigating objects that it is uncertain
about. More successful homo sapiens are generally those who push themselves
outside their comfort zone and navigate through unfamiliar circumstances. 
Suppose deep learning models do in some sense mimic how human brain works, then can 
we use the success story of those donquixotic apes to train our models? 
In this post, let’s study the notion of model’s uncertainty and use it in our training
process</p>
