  <p>As we have seen from my <a href="https://hsl89.github.io/uncertainty-of-deep-neural-network/">previous post</a>.
The probability vector of
a deterministic network cannot consistently capture the uncertainty of its
prediction. And we have also seen that if we use the entropy of the probablity 
vector as a proxy to uncertainty, the performance of active learning is 
pretty bad. In this post, I want to discuss some basics of Bayesian 
statistics and using it to study the model uncertainty. Then we will use 
this uncertainty to design an active learning query strategy.</p>
